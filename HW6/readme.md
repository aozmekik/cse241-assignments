As we discussed in the lectures, Java has a very structured Collections library. We can develop a
similar library for C++ that use STL classes underneath. We will implement some the interfaces
(abstract classes with pure virtual functions only), some concrete classes, and some of the helper
classes such as iterators.

The above figure shows a simplified version of the Collections. We will write corresponding
templated classes for Collection, Set, List, Queue, which are all abstract classes with all pure virtual
functions with no data members. HashSet, ArrayList, and LinkedList are concrete classes. Note that
LinkedList uses multiple inheritance. Following table defines the functions for each class

Class Name Public Function Name Definition

**Collection** (^) This is a templated class with two template parameters like the std::stack class of STL. The
first parameter is the template type E and the second parameter is the STL container that will
do all the work for us.
**iterator()**
Returns an iterator over the collection^
**add(E e)**
Ensures that this collection contains the specified element^
**addAll(Collection c)**
Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this
collection
**clear()**
Removes all of the elements from this collection^
**contains(E e)**
Returns true if this collection contains the specified element.^
**containsAll(Collection c)**
Returns true if this collection contains all of the elements in the
specified collection.
**isEmpty()**
Returns true if this collection contains no elements.^
**remove(E e)** (^) Removes a single instance of the specified element from this


(^) collection, if it is present
**removeAll(Collection c)**
Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained
in the specified collection
**retainAll(Collection c)** (^) Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in
the specified collection
**size()** (^) Returns the number of elements in this collection.
**Set** (^) A collection that contains no duplicate elements. There is no order for this collection. In other
words, you donâ€™t have to keep the insertion order of the elements.
**List** (^) An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise
control over where in the list each element is inserted.
**Queue** (^) Queues order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. There is no random access with
this Collection. Some functions throw exceptions.
**add(E e)** (^) Inserts the specified element into this queue
**element()** (^) Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.
**offer(E e)** (^) Inserts the specified element into this queue
**poll()**
Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or throws if this
queue is empty.
**HashSet** (^) Implements Set functions
**ArrayList** (^) Implements List functions
**LinkedList** (^) Implements both List and Queue functions. Your class does not have to have a linked list to
implement these.
**Iterator hasNext()**^ Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
**next()**
Returns the next element in the iteration and advances the
iterator.
**remove()**
Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned
by this iterator
Your C++ Collections hierarchy should use only STL containers in the concrete classes to implement
all the functions. Second parameter of the Collection template can be any of **std::vector** (default
container) **, std::list,** and **std::set**.
You will test each function of each concrete class with template parameters of int and string. You will
also use the three possible containers with all combinations.
Notes:

- Define and use your namespace.
- Do error and range checking for any parameters. Throw exceptions and test them in your
    client code. Do not forget to define the throw lists for your functions.
- For each class you will write its own header .h file and .cpp file for the separation of interface
    and implementation.
- As expected, you should follow all object-oriented programming principles and all submission
    rules.
- You should submit your work to the moodle page.
- You should submit the header and source code files and sample output results.
