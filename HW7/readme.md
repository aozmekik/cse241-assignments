In this homework, you will write a Java Shape hierarchy that you wrote already for HW5 in C++.

Interface **Shape** defines at least the following method.

- **area** that returns the area of the shape
- **perimeter** that returns the perimeter
- Functions **increment** and **decrement** for incrementing and decrementing the shape
    positions by 1.0.
- This interface implements the **Comparable** interface to compare shapes with respect to their
    areas.
- Draw takes a **Graphics** object as parameter and draws the shape. This method will be called
    from the **paintComponent** method of a **JPanel** object.

Class **Rectangle, Triangle, Circle** and **ComposedShape** all implement the **Shape**
interface. They behave like the classes in HW3. Class ComposedShape keeps an array of Shape
references for the shape elements.

**Polygon** is an abstract class that implements. **PolygonVect and PolygonDyn** are two
concrete classes that derive from **Polygon** class. One of them uses Collection class ArrayList
vectors to keep the 2D points, the other uses Java arrays to keep the 2D points.

We also define the following static methods in a separate class

- Method drawAll takes an array of Shape references and draws all shapes to an JPanel
- Method convertAll takes an array of Shape references, converts all shapes to Polygons and
    returns a new array with the new shapes.
- Method sortShapes takes an array of Shapes and increasingly sorts them with respect to their
    areas.

Use the program that our TA Ahmet SoyyiÄŸit showed you during the PS to draw this shape hierarchy
In UML diagrams and submit the results.

Notes:

- Do error and range checking for any parameters. Throw exceptions and test them in your
    client code. Do not forget to define the throw lists for your functions.
- For each class you will write appropriate class documentation for Javadoc. You will also
    submit the Javadoc files.


- As expected, you should follow all object-oriented programming principles.
- You should submit your work to the moodle page.
- You should submit the images of drawn shapes.
