As we discussed in the lectures, Java has a very structured Collections library. We can develop a
similar simplified library for Java that uses arrays underneath. We will implement some the interfaces
some abstract class, some concrete classes, and some of the helper classes such as iterators.

The above figure shows a simplified version of the Collections. We will write corresponding generic
classes for Collection, Set, List, Queue, which are all interfaces. HashSet, ArrayList, and LinkedList
are concrete classes. Note that LinkedList uses multiple inheritance. Following table defines the
functions for each class

Class Name Public Method Name Definition

**Collection** (^) This is a generic class with one generic parameters which is the generic type E.
**iterator()**
Returns an iterator over the collection^
**add(E e)**
Ensures that this collection contains the specified element^
**addAll(Collection c)**
Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this
collection
**clear()**
Removes all of^ the elements from this collection^
**contains(E e)**
Returns true if this collection contains the specified element.^
**containsAll(Collection c)**
Returns true if this collection contains all of^ the elements in the
specified collection.
**isEmpty()**
Returns true if this collection contains no elements.^
**remove(E e)**
Removes a single instance of the specified element from this
collection, if it is present
**removeAll(Collection c)**
Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained
in the specified collection


**retainAll(Collection c)** (^) Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in
the specified collection
**size()** (^) Returns the number of elements in this collection.
**Set** (^) A collection that contains no duplicate elements. There is no order for this collection. In other
words, you donâ€™t have to keep the insertion order of the elements.
**List** (^) An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise
control over where in the list each element is inserted.
**Queue** (^) Queues order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. There is no random access with
this Collection. Some functions throw exceptions.
**add(E e)** (^) Inserts the specified element into this queue
**element()** (^) Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue.
**offer(E e)** (^) Inserts the specified element into this queue
**poll()**
Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or throws if this
queue is empty.
**HashSet** (^) Implements Set functions
**ArrayList** (^) Implements List functions
**LinkedList** (^) Implements both List and Queue functions. Your class does not have to have a linked list to
implement these.
**Iterator hasNext()**^ Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
**next()**
Returns the next element in the iteration and advances the
iterator.
**remove()**
Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned
by this iterator
Your Java Collections hierarchy should use only Java arrays in the concrete classes to implement all
the methods.
You will test each method of each concrete class with generic parameters of int and string.
Notes:

- Do error and range checking for any parameters. Throw exceptions and test them in your
    client code. Do not forget to define the throw lists for your functions.
- For each class you will write appropriate class documentation for Javadoc. You will also
    submit the Javadoc files.
- As expected, you should follow all object-oriented programming principles.
- You should submit your work to the moodle page.
- You should submit the images of drawn shapes.
